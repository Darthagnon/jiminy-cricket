## Project history
Project started by a friend I met via a groupchat on the [Tox Directory](https://tox.directory/) on [qTox](https://qtox.github.io/).

He doesn't seem to think much of Cricket:
>Friend: remember, the bot is ONLY a proof of concept.
>Friend: it's crap, but it will show you how to work with the tox library.
>Friend: I probably should write up man pages for it.
>Friend: I don't care, it's junk.
>Friend: I don't want credit, the code is embarassing.

I will be trying to learn C/C++ development with this project.
