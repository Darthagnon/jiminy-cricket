# now for my crap bot (you'll have to download it if you don't already
# have it).  You should ONLY hgave server_bot3.cpp

g++ -Wall -g -o server_bot server_bot3.cpp -lsodium -I /usr/local/include/ -ltoxcore
./server_bot

# now it will be running.  It will print out the (newly generated) tox_id
# when it starts.  Once it creates a tox_id (that's in the file savedata.tox)
# it will use the same tox_id no matter how often you restart it.
#
# be careful not to run two instances at the same time.  If you do, the
# bot will seem to be going up and down all the time, and you may corrupt
# the savedata.tox file.
